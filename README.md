# sentiment-detection-data
A repo to publicly host a dataset of tweets and their sentiments as a csv file

The data is a CSV with emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:
0 - the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
1 - the id of the tweet (2087)
2 - the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
3 - the query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
4 - the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
5 - the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)

This dataset was pulled from Kaggle, and was not authored by me.
